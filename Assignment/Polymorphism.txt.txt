1)List down some of java methodâ€™s where method overloading is used.
Ans: 1)The Math class has a number of methods that are overloaded, such as the pow() method, which can be used to calculate the power of a number.
     2)The Scanner class has a number of methods that are overloaded, such as the next() method, which can be used to read the next token from the input stream.
     3)The String class has a number of methods that are overloaded, such as the indexOf() method, which can be used to find the index of a character or substring 
       in a string.

2)Overload method by changing data type of argument and keeping same number of argument. 
Ans: 
  public class Addition{

    public static void main(String[] args) 
{
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;

        add(a, b);
        add(10.0, 20.0);
    }

    static void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("The sum of a and b is " + (a + b));
    }

    static void add(double a, double b) {
        System.out.println("The sum of a and b is " + (a + b));
    }
}

3)Calculate area of Circle, Triangle, Rectangle using method overloading.
Ans: 
 class Area
{
public int calculateArea(double rad)
{
	return 3.14 * rad * rad;
}
public int calculateArea(double base, double height)
{
       	return 0.5 * base * height;
}
public int calculateArea(double length, double width) 
{
       	return length * width;
}
}

4) What is the advantage of method overloading?
Ans:
    1)Improves readability and flexibility of code.
    2)Reduces code duplication.
    3)Allows you to use the same method name for different purposes
    4)Allows you to use the same method name for different classes
    5)Allows you to use the same method name for methods with different return types.
